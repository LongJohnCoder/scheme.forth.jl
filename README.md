scheme.forth.jl
---------------

A hobby scheme implementation for FORTH 83. Specifically it is targeted at my
own [forth.jl](http://github.com/tgvaughan/forth.jl) which is an implementation
of FORTH on top of [Julia](http://www.julialang.org), hence the name.  However
it does not rely on anything but standard FORTH 83 words.
