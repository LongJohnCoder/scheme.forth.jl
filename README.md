scheme.forth.jl
---------------

A hobby scheme implementation for FORTH 83. Specifically it is targeted at 
[forth.jl](http://github.com/tgvaughan/forth.jl) which is an implementation
of FORTH on top of [Julia](http://www.julialang.org), hence the name.

The eventual goal of this project is to have scheme.forth.jl capable of being
used to complete all of the exercises in the book
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).
(Fun fact: chapter 4 implements a metacircular evaluator, at which point we will have
scheme in scheme in forth in julia!)
